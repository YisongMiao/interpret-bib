This repo is Yisong's opinionated bibliography about mechanistic interpretability (MI) in NLP. \
They say the best way to learn is to teach other people. Here comes this repo. \

[This survey from GMU](https://github.com/Dakingrai/awesome-mechanistic-interpretability-lm-papers) and [this tutorial by ZJU](https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowledgeEditingPapers) are already very comprehensive. This repo focuses on (1) how a beginner builds the knowledge; (2) the weaknesses of existing works.
